# Recipe Explorer & Meal Planner

## Overview

**Recipe Explorer & Meal Planner** is a full-stack web application designed to teach and illustrate the entire lifecycle of software developmentâ€”from ideation and coding to testing, deployment, and iterative improvements. This project will cover:

- **Front-End Development:** Building a dynamic, user-friendly interface with React and TypeScript.
- **Back-End Development:** Creating a robust RESTful API using FastAPI (Python) that interacts with multiple databases.
- **Databases:** Utilizing PostgreSQL for structured, relational data and MongoDB for unstructured or semi-structured data.
- **Testing:** Implementing unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to ensure code quality.
- **Deployment & CI/CD:** Automating testing and deployment using GitHub Actions, deploying to platforms like Heroku (back-end) and Vercel/Netlify (front-end).

This project is structured as an educational journey in software development, with each phase teaching key concepts and skills while building a real-world application.

## Objectives

- **Learn Full-Stack Development:** Understand how to create a complete application that covers both the front-end and back-end.
- **Implement Best Practices:** Adopt industry standards for coding, testing, version control, and deployment.
- **Database Integration:** Work with both relational (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases.
- **API Integration:** Consume external APIs (for recipe data) and create your own API endpoints.
- **Iterative Development:** Continuously improve the application based on testing, user feedback, and performance optimizations.

## Key Features

1. **Recipe Discovery:**

   - Integrate with an external recipe API (e.g., Spoonacular or Edamam) to fetch and display recipes.
   - Implement search and filtering options (by ingredients, dietary preferences, cuisine types).

2. **User Management:**

   - User registration, login, and profile management.
   - Secure authentication and authorization flows.

3. **Meal Planning & Social Interaction:**

   - Allow users to save favorite recipes and create personalized meal plans.
   - Enable users to post reviews, ratings, and cooking tips.

4. **Data Storage:**

   - **Relational Database (PostgreSQL):** For structured data such as user profiles, reviews, and meal plans.
   - **NoSQL Database (MongoDB):** For handling session data, logs, and caching recipe information.

5. **Testing & Quality Assurance:**

   - Write unit and integration tests for both the front-end and back-end.
   - Use linting and formatting tools to maintain high code quality.

6. **Continuous Integration/Deployment:**
   - Set up automated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.
   - Deploy the back-end (e.g., on Heroku) and front-end (e.g., on Vercel or Netlify).

## Technology Stack

- **Back-End:** Python with FastAPI
- **Front-End:** React with TypeScript
- **Databases:**
  - **PostgreSQL:** For relational, structured data.
  - **MongoDB:** For unstructured or semi-structured data.
- **Testing Tools:**
  - **Python:** Pytest
  - **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Jest and React Testing Library
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
- **Deployment Platforms:**
  - **Back-End:** Heroku (or similar)
  - **Front-End:** Vercel or Netlify

### Component Interactions

- **Front-End:**

  - Provides the user interface and handles user interactions.
  - Fetches data from the back-end via HTTP requests and displays it dynamically.

- **Back-End:**

  - Manages application logic and processes incoming API requests.
  - Interacts with both PostgreSQL and MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.
  - Returns data in JSON format for the front-end.

- **Databases:**
  - **PostgreSQL** stores structured data like user accounts, reviews, and meal plans.
  - **MongoDB** manages unstructured data such as session information, logs, or cached data.

## Roadmap & Next Steps

1. **Phase 1: Ideation & Environment Setup**

   - Finalize the project plan.
   - Set up the development environment (backend, frontend, virtual environment, and database connections).
   - Establish a GitHub repository with a proper folder structure.

2. **Phase 2: Back-End API Development**

   - Build RESTful endpoints using FastAPI.
   - Integrate external recipe APIs and manage database connections.
